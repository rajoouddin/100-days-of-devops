# 100-days-of-devops

Iâ€™ve taken on KodeKloudâ€™s **100 Days of DevOps Challenge** as a way to push myself to stay consistent, committed, and to test my knowledge in a structured way.  

This repo documents my journey: each dayâ€™s challenge, reflection notes, the commands I used, issues I faced, and how I solved them.  

Why am I doing this?  
- To prove to myself (and others) that persistence beats background.  
- To show that moving from HR to DevOps is possible if you commit.  
- To build a public record of learning that can help and inspire others.  

ðŸ’¡ My end goal:  
At the end of these 100 days, I want to **showcase my skills and knowledge** through a tangible portfolio. My aim is to help businesses â€” especially small ones â€” streamline and secure their systems with DevOps practices.  

> "_Procrastination or laziness is a habit of focusing on the tasks at hand rather than the end goal._"  
This is the quote Iâ€™m holding onto as I go through this challenge.  

Iâ€™ll also be posting progress on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajoo-uddin/recent-activity/all/) every 10 days to keep myself accountable. If youâ€™re reading this â€” feel free to follow along or even join me.
